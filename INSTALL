INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Before you start, you will of course need to have Python installed,
version 2.3 or better.  Get it from www.python.org if you don't have
it already.  It's very portable and easily built.

Now, you're ready to build MissingPy.

You'll need GHC 6.8.

Next, download and install MissingH, version 1.0.1 or above.  Grab it
from http://software.complete.org/missingh.  Debian users can
apt-get install libghc6-missingh-dev.

This will generate the build file MissingPy.cabal.  Look at the
declarations near the top and edit them if necessary.

Now, run "make setup" (you may need to edit the Makefile if you don't
use GHC or if your GHC is at an unusual location).

Then:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
 
Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test
